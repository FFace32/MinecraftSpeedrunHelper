# MinecraftSpeedrunHelper

I wanted to learn how I could do my usual shenanigans of hooking functions and whatnot in C++, but in a Java game, so I had to
learn about JNI then I had to learn about JVMTI and then I had to learn about the internals of the Java .class file
format and Java bytecode...

This project is an usage example for my upcoming library *cppjavahook*. (very creative name, indeed)

This was only tested on x64 Windows and it's meant for vanilla Minecraft 1.16.2 only.

Note: The --recursive option should be used when cloning.
